st.subheader('Resting Blood Pressure')
st.write('''Blood Pressure is the pressure of the blood within the arteries. It is produced primarily by the contraction 
of the heart muscle. Its measurement is recorded by two numbers. The first(systolic pressure) is measured after the heart 
contracts and is highest. The second(diastolic pressure) is measured before the heart contracts and is the lowest. 
A blood pressure cuff is used to measure the pressure. Elevation of blood pressure is called 'hypertension'. 
BP below 120/80 mm Hg is considered to be normal.''')
